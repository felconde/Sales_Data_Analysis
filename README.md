# Sales Data Analysis

This project is a simple data analysis program that performs sales data analysis using Python. It reads a CSV file containing sales data, processes the data, and provides insights into the sales performance. The program utilizes popular libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy.

## Libraries Used
- Pandas: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. It is used to load and process the sales data from a CSV file.
- Matplotlib: A widely used plotting library in Python. It is used to create visualizations, such as bar charts, to represent the sales data.
- NumPy: A fundamental library for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for numerical operations and calculations.
